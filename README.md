# Transform based neural network
Extension of DCT-based harmonic networks ([this paper](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Rozenn.Dahyot/pdf/Harmonic_BMVC2019.pdf)) to two other transforms: Slant and Hadamard.

Some buiding blocks include my version of a harmonic block (different from that in the paper slightly), harmonic convolution (convolution with the transform-based filter). I also put some models that I experimented with. This is a work in progress.
